,score,Did you use the map feature, why and why not?
1,6,no. it only showed the area where I live. I would like to make a challenge in Oslo but I could zoom out of the map and it was to far to find this close up.But I like the idea. it enables you to see very quickly what is going on in your neighbourhood. 
2,6,No, there were no challenges nearby where I live so there was no point in using it. 
3,6,No. I prefer not for everyone to know where I am.
4,6,Rarely because I live far away from the city. Everything around me I’ve done before, so I didn’t feel like adding activities either 


5,6,no, not sure for what it is

6,6,no, didn’t investigate this application much 
7,6,I love it. Adds depth
