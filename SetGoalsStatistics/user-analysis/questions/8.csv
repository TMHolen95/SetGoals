,score,What did you and did not like about the view data feature? Check-ins is shown in image but consider the other logging options as well.
1,2,I missed being able to log activity I had already done but had forgotten to log. Now the app is about also remembering to log the activity which I wish it could have helped me with.
 
2,3,I did not really log much data other than setting goals to complete 
3,4,nice way to see how often I would check-in. 
4,3,only used it once 
5,3,itâ€™s ok
