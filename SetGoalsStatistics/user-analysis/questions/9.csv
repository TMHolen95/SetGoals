,score,How did you feel about having to log the data on the same day you did your activity? (Not being able to add entries for previous days)
1,6,I didn't like it. 
2,6,I did not know that was a thing! 
3,6,Not really my cup of tea. I often forgot to add things to the app. If I wanted a lot of points I could probably just add lots of activities on the same day and check them off without actually doing them. 
4,6,Kinda discouraging as I would sometimes forget to track my progress right there and then 
5,6,it would be better to be able to add it for previous days too
6,6,I didn’t try this, but I would like more user control to actually log when I have the time. I don’t think people would cheat themselves 
7,6,It's restrictive.
