,score,Would you continue to use this application, why or why not?
1,1,I think it's a great idea tgat I have not seen before. I hope to use the social feature when I know more people where I live.( Now I just figured out so can make my boyfriend do chores around the house which is great and fun. :) haha
2,2,It's simply not for me 
3,2,I'm not a motivational-app, kind of person
4,3,I am an active user of the reminders app on iOS, so I do see the appeal. I would however want to see more content 
5,2,Iâ€™m using other application for logging my goals and time spend on it 
6,3,unsure. I have never found applications like this to be helpful for me to reach my goal. i dont see the point in making this as a social application. I set goals for myself, not to compete with others 
7,1,Best friend points!
