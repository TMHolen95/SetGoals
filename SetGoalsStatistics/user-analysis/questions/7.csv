,score,What did you and did not like about the goal logging feature?
1,4,I think the social feature could have been explained in the start. I thought I got points for being social. But When you told me what it is about I liked the concept. 
2,2,It was a bit tedious UI wise. Being able to view, edit and log a goal should probably be in the same place. From a page specific for that goal 
3,3,It was very customizable, could have been slightly more intuitive or aesthetically pleasing.
4,4,Could benefit from more example  goals . since I do make goals  every now and then, I just forget to put them into the app before I’ve completed the goal 

Logging is nice when I remember to use it. 
5,3,stopwatch or timer would be useful
6,2,it doesn’t make sense to have to provide a description of a goal. when you decide to log, it does not provide any information about how it works. i chose daily logs, but could only check one. there is no status or information that shows my progress. 
7,5,Like it
