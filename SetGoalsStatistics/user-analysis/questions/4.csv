,score,Did you feel the application's social features (posts and comments) were useful for your progress?
1,6,no not really. I live a place where I dont know many people where I live so I didn't have anyone to challenge. 
2,6,Not necessarily for me. It's probably nice if you have a lot of friends using it though 
3,6,Not really. The activity/hobby related ones were more to my liking.
4,6,I don’t know who else is using the app, except for one person. I feel it would require a better way to find friends in order to build a network and take advantage of the social features 
5,6,maybe if I would have more friends added 
6,6,haven’t really used much of the application
7,6,Its fun
